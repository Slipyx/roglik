- INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the readme file for the open source game roglik. roglik is an open
source game project mainly to experiment with version control, project hosting,
and open source licenses. Hopefully this will also give me a boost in
motivation and continue learning the ways of game programming and programming
in general. If this goes well, I intend to get deeper into design and build
upon it to make a full-fledged open source indie game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- COMPILING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

roglik is programmed in C++ (I use Code::Blocks with MSVC compiler). Currently,
the only external library used is SFML-2.0. SFML-2.0 is currently in
development, so it is only available in source form. You will need to obtain
the SFML-2.0 source and build the libraries first before you can compile
roglik. SFML-2.0 is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML
Building SFML-2.0 is pretty easy as it uses CMake. Once you have SFML-2.0
libraries built, you can then compile roglik. roglik links with sfml-audio,
sfml-graphics, sfml-window, sfml-system, and sfml-main. Hopefully, this is
enough information for you to successfully compile roglik and get it running.

- CONCLUSION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Well, this is the end of the readme, thank you for reading it! (Or at least
bothering to open it and skim to the bottom ^_^.) I hope this information was
beneficial for you and you have an idea of what this is about and are able to
build and run roglik on your system. This is my first readme I have ever
written so I apologize for any problems contained within or any headaches or
other mental discomfort I may have caused you. Feel free to email me any
comments, suggestions, or issues you may have about this project. Thanks again!
